## 📖 About

**BazaarMind** bridges the gap between traditional commerce and digital intelligence for the unorganized retail sector in Bangladesh. Unlike cold, corporate analytics tools, BazaarMind is designed to feel like a trusted business partner ("Munshiji")—warm, intuitive, and collaborative.

### Design Philosophy

- **Warm & Human:** Interfaces designed with empathy, avoiding data overload.
- **SME-Focused:** Tailored workflows for small traders, wholesalers, and shopkeepers.
- **AI as Partner:** Recommendations are presented as collaborative advice, not robotic commands.
- **Narrative Layout:** Information flows as a story (Pulse → Action → Alert), not just a grid of metrics.
- **Hyper-Localized:** Authentic typography (Hind Siliguri) and Bengali-first context.
